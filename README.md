# forecast-cereal-ratings
In this project i am working in pre-processing the cereals dataset by encoding the categorical features using OneHotEncoder and the ordinal features using OrdinalEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing. These encoded features will be used to train a predictive model to accurately forecast cereal ratings based on characteristics such as manufacturer, type, nutritional values, and shelf placement. This step ensures that the data is in an optimal format for machine learning, improving the model's performance in predicting the target variable."
